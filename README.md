# Collector for MIMU Datasets

This script connects to the [MIMU API](https://geonode.themimu.info/layers/) and extracts data layer by layer creating a dataset per layer in HDX. It makes 1 read from MIMU and 250 read/writes (API calls) to HDX in a one hour period. It is run every month.

## Development

### Environment

Development is currently done using Python 3.13. We recommend using a virtual
environment such as ``venv``:

```shell
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
```

In your virtual environment, install all packages for development by running:

```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing and running

For the script to run, you will need to have a file called
.hdx_configuration.yaml in your home directory containing your HDX key, e.g.:

    hdx_key: "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
    hdx_read_only: false
    hdx_site: prod

 You will also need to supply the universal .useragents.yaml file in your home
 directory as specified in the parameter *user_agent_config_yaml* passed to
 facade in run.py. The collector reads the key
 **hdx-scraper-mimu** as specified in the parameter
 *user_agent_lookup*.

 Alternatively, you can set up environment variables: `USER_AGENT`, `HDX_KEY`,
`HDX_SITE`, `EXTRA_PARAMS`, `TEMP_DIR`, and `LOG_FILE_ONLY`.

To install and run, execute:

```shell
    pip install .
    python -m hdx.scraper.mimu
```

### Pre-commit

Be sure to install `pre-commit`, which is run every time you make a git commit:

```shell
    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install
```

With pre-commit, all code is formatted according to
[ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) guidelines.

To check if your changes pass pre-commit without committing, run:

```shell
    pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Testing

Ensure you have the required packages to run the tests:

```shell
    pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

To run the tests and view coverage, execute:

```shell
    pytest -c --cov hdx
```

## Packages

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is used for package management.  If
youâ€™ve introduced a new package to the source code (i.e. anywhere in `src/`),
please add it to the `project.dependencies` section of `pyproject.toml` with
any known version constraints.

To add packages required only for testing, add them to the `test` section under
`[project.optional-dependencies]`.

Any changes to the dependencies will be automatically reflected in
`requirements.txt` and `requirements-test.txt` with `pre-commit`, but you can
re-generate the files without committing by executing:

```shell
    pre-commit run pip-compile --all-files
```

## Project

[Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) is used for project management. The project can be built using:

```shell
    hatch build
```

Linting and syntax checking can be run with:

```shell
    hatch fmt --check
```

Tests can be executed using:

```shell
    hatch test
```
